    <h2 class="heading">Why reset at all? (What problem does it solve?)</h2>
    <p>
      Resets basically wipe out all the weird default styles every browser adds on its own.
      Back in the day, browsers all had super different paddings, margins, line-heights, and
      random styling on things like lists or headings. It made designs look different in every
      browser unless you manually fixed all of that. A reset forces everything to start from
      the same baseline.

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">Why Josh’s version over Eric’s? (2–3 differences)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Josh’s reset is more “modern-browser-aware,” so he skips a lot of the blanket
      zero-everything approach from 2007. He focuses on actual pain points we still deal
      with now.</li>
      <li>Josh keeps useful defaults like headings staying bold, instead of wiping everything
      like Eric’s reset did.</li>
      <li>Josh adds modern fixes (like text-wrap: balance; and smoothing for media and
      buttons) that didn’t exist back then, so it’s more tuned to real 2020s problems instead
      of old issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">How do you actually use these? (Link tag? Import? Inline?)</h2>
    <p>You just put the CSS reset at the very top of your stylesheet.</p>
    <p>Options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;link&gt; to an external reset.css file</li>
      <li>Or copy/paste it at the top of your main CSS file</li>
      <li>Or @import it but that’s kind of discouraged now because it slows loading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most people just paste it directly into their CSS as the first thing.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">What’s a CSS boilerplate? (vs. a reset)</h2>
    <p>
      A reset wipes everything clean.<br>
      A boilerplate adds a bunch of helpful starting styles like default font stacks, spacing
      rules, utility classes, styling for buttons, form elements, etc.<br>
      It’s basically a “starter kit” for your CSS, not just a cleanup.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">Why use a boilerplate? (When does it help/hurt?)</h2>
    <p>
      It helps when you’re starting a project and want the basics already set up so you’re
      not reinventing boring stuff (like buttons or form spacing).<br>
      It hurts if you don’t need all of it, it can add a ton of styles you end up fighting against
      or deleting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">Why is Normalize.css different from resets? (Philosophy shift)</h2>
    <p>
      Normalize doesn’t wipe everything out.<br>
      Instead of clearing all defaults, it tries to make the browser defaults consistent. So
      instead of “zero everything,” it’s “keep the good defaults, fix the weird ones.”<br>
      It’s more gentle, more practical, and less destructive than the old-school resets.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">What changed between 2007 and now? (From Meyer to modern resets)</h2>
    <p>
      Browsers are way more consistent now, so we don’t need to nuke literally everything
      anymore.<br>
      Developers realized that destroying all default styles was actually a pain because
      you had to restyle basic elements from scratch.<br>
      Modern resets focus on small, targeted fixes things browsers still disagree on (like
      images, buttons, text wrapping), not the giant universal wipeout.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">What browser inconsistencies bothered developers in 2007?</h2>
    <p>
      Stuff like random margins on &lt;body&gt;, different default line-height, lists showing
      bullets differently, headings having different sizes in every browser, and form
      elements being totally inconsistent between browsers. Basically everything looked
      unpredictable.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="heading">Other reset/normalize approaches (2–3 examples)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Normalize.css: The famous “don’t wipe everything, just fix inconsistencies”
      approach.</li>
      <li>Sanitize.css: A modern, more opinionated normalizer.</li>
      <li>Andy Bell’s Modern CSS Reset: Minimal and focused on practical issues.</li>
    </ul>
