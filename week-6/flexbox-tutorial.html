      <h2>What is Flexbox?</h2>
      <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that distributes space along a single axis—either rows or columns. It makes common UI patterns (nav bars, media objects, split layouts) much easier than floats or table hacks.</p>
      <p>With a flex container, children become flex items that intelligently size, wrap, align, and stretch. You control their behavior with a small set of properties that work predictably across screen sizes.</p>

    <section id="section-2">
      <h2>Flex Containers</h2>
      <p>The “parent” becomes a flex container when you set <code>display: flex</code> (or <code>inline-flex</code>). This flips on a layout context where all direct children are flex items. Key properties: <code>flex-direction</code>, <code>flex-wrap</code>, <code>gap</code>, <code>align-items</code>, and <code>justify-content</code>.</p>
      <p>In this page, <code>.container</code> is the flex parent and its direct children are the sidebar and the content area—two columns, one fixed and one flexible.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="section-3">
      <h2>Flex Items</h2>
      <p>Flex items respond to <code>flex</code> (shorthand for grow, shrink, basis). For example, a fixed sidebar can use <code>flex: 0 0 300px</code> while the content uses <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code> to take remaining space and shrink as needed.</p>
      <p>You can also reorder items with <code>order</code> and override alignment per item using <code>align-self</code>.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="section-4">
      <h2>Alignment &amp; Justify</h2>
      <p><code>justify-content</code> positions items along the main axis (left-to-right in rows, top-to-bottom in columns), while <code>align-items</code> works along the cross axis. Use <code>gap</code> instead of margins for clean, consistent spacing between items.</p>
      <p>For complex vertical centering, flexbox eliminates historical hacks and gives you reliable alignment with a single property.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="section-5">
      <h2>Real-World Patterns</h2>
      <p>Common patterns include fixed sidebars with flexible articles, card rows that wrap, and responsive toolbars that space controls intelligently. By mixing <code>flex-basis</code>, growth, and shrink rules, you can model many production layouts with minimal CSS.</p>
      <p>Remember: Flexbox is one-dimensional; for full grids, prefer CSS Grid—or combine both where each shines.</p>

<!-- Reflections (paste your answers below this line as plain text) 
A — Reflection (IDs): Having a unique id for each section lets you link directly to that part of the page, which is helpful for navigation and accessibility. Ids can only be used once but classes can be used many times, so mixing them up could cause an error. 
B — Reflection (width vs. basis): I think the flexbox parent is the .container element because it holds both the sidebar and the content because it lets those two parts sit side by side. 
C — Reflection (sticky vs. fixed): I think width gives something a set size, while flex-basis is like its starting point in a flex layout that can change depending on space. I would use flex-basis when I want the layout to stay flexible and width when I want something to always stay the same size. Sticky moves with the page until it hits a set spot, then stays there. Fixed stays in one place on the screen the whole time.
D — Reflection (fixed header): If you add a fixed header it could cover the section titles when you click a link. Using scroll-margin top adds space at the top so the heading isnt hidden under the header.
E — Reflection (decoration & usability): I made the icons light and low opacity so they wouldn't cover the text. For dark and light themes I would maybe change their brightness or color so they still stand out but don't cause readability issues.
F — Reflection (biggest usability win): Adding a clear focus style helps the most because it shows which link or section you're on. It makes the page easier to use for everyone.
