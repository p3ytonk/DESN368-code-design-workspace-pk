        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>Learn, Build, and play smarter in The Sims 4</p>
        <p>Step into the digital world of The Sims 4, where creativity and chaos go hand in hand. This handbook charts the tools, systems, and secrets that shape every Sim’s story.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 1 -->
      <section id="section1" class="card">
        <div class="badge" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <h2>Section 1: Getting Started with The Sims 4</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>The Sims 4 is a life simulation game where you create and control digital people known as Sims. Each Sim has unique traits, aspirations, and emotions that shape how they interact with the world. When starting a new save, you’ll begin in Create-A-Sim (CAS) which is a powerful editor where you design your characters’ looks, outfits, and personalities. You can customize every detail from their hairstyle to their walk style and even their zodiac sign in some expansions.</p>
        <p>Once your Sims are ready, you’ll choose a neighborhood like Willow Creek or Oasis Springs. Each world has distinct lots, community spaces, and neighbors. Use the Gallery to download homes or Sims from other players. Remember to use the in-game console (press <code>Ctrl + Shift + C</code>) to open the cheat bar. The cheat bar is a handy tool for testing or customizing your experience.</p>
        <h3>Key steps to start your game:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open Create-A-Sim and design your household.</li>
          <li>Choose a world and move into a lot.</li>
          <li>Build, decorate, and start your Sim’s daily life.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 2 -->
      <section id="section2" class="card">
        <div class="badge" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <h2>Section 2: Building and Decorating Homes</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>The Build/Buy Mode is the creative heart of The Sims 4. You can design anything from cozy cottages to modern mansions using the game’s grid-based building system. Start by switching modes with <code>F2</code> or clicking the hammer icon. Use Rooms to quickly add pre-made layouts, or build freeform with walls, floors, and roofs.</p>
        <p>Every object has Simoleons ( § ) value and aesthetic style tags like Modern, Boho, or Industrial. You can rotate objects with <code>R</code> and fine-tune placement using <code>Alt</code> (for off-grid movement) or <code>[ / ]</code> (for resizing). Lighting and color swatches let you personalize your space.</p>
        <h3>Tips for efficient building:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use bb.moveobjects in cheat console to freely place items.</li>
          <li>Create multi-level homes using the Foundation Height tool.</li>
          <li>Save custom rooms to reuse them across builds.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 3 -->
      <section id="section3" class="card">
        <div class="badge" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <h2>Section 3: Managing Sims and Their Needs</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>Each Sim has six core needs: Hunger, Energy, Fun, Social, Bladder, and Hygiene which are visible as green or red bars in the UI. Keeping these balanced ensures happiness and productivity. Use the Needs Panel (<code>Y</code>) to check their current state. When things get rough, use the command <code>fillmotive motive_hunger</code> to instantly satisfy one need during testing.</p>
        <p>Sims also have Emotions like Inspired, Sad, or Confident, which influence available actions. For instance, a Focused Sim performs better in logic or programming tasks. Moodlets, small icons under the portrait, show what triggered each emotion.</p>
        <h3>Core management reminders:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use bb.moveobjects in cheat console to freely place items.</li>
          <li>Create multi-level homes using the Foundation Height tool.</li>
          <li>Save custom rooms to reuse them across builds.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 4 -->
      <section id="section4" class="card">
        <div class="badge" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <h2>Section 4: Careers, Skills, and Progression</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>Sims can pursue structured careers or freelance paths. Traditional jobs (like Tech Guru or Painter) require clock-in hours and daily tasks, while freelance careers let you choose gigs via the computer. The command <code>careers.promote [career]</code> boosts your Sim’s job rank instantly which is useful for debugging or storytelling.</p>
        <h3>Progression relies on Skills, which level from 1–10. Some examples include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooking: Improves meal quality and unlocks gourmet dishes.</li>
          <li>Programming: Enables mod creation for extra income.</li>
          <li>Painting: Unlocks art styles and higher sale prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Promotions grant Simoleon bonuses and unlock unique work interactions. Use Aspirations as long-term goals to guide your Sim’s lifestyle. Completing them earns Satisfaction Points that can be spent on Reward Traits.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 5 -->
      <section id="section5" class="card">
        <div class="badge" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <h2>Section 5: Expansions, Mods, and Customization</h2>
        <div class="rule"></div>
        <p>The Sims 4 ecosystem thrives on new content. Expansion packs like Seasons or Cottage Living add worlds, gameplay mechanics, and careers. Game Packs and Stuff Packs offer smaller themes such as Realm of Magic or Tiny Living.</p>
        <p>For advanced players, mods and custom content (CC) transform the game even further. Mods like MC Command Center allow detailed control over population, autonomy, and story progression. To install them, place downloaded files into the <code>Documents → Electronic Arts → The Sims 4 → Mods</code> folder and enable Custom Content in settings.</p>
        <h3>Before Adding Mods:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Back up your saves.</li>
          <li>Check mod compatibility after updates.</li>
          <li>Keep scripts in <code>.ts4script</code> format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exploring these tools lets you tailor The Sims 4 to your creative vision, whether you’re building a supernatural world, running a family legacy, or crafting the perfect digital community.</p>
