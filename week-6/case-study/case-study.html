      <h2>What design choices did you make and why?</h2>
      <p>I wanted my overall design to capture both a coding and gaming feel while trying to keep the creative vibe that The Sims 4 has. The color choices and layout were meant to feel balanced and sort of tech inspired. I used bold colors and a soft gradient background to give the site personality without making it feel too busy.</p>
      <p>The typefaces and icons made the design feel pretty modern while also having a digital style. I also tried to keep everything structured and logical, kind of like code itself. I wanted it to feel approachable with the combination of creativity and organization.</p>

      <h2>What was difficult to code? How did you solve it?</h2>
      <p>One of the hardest parts of coding this project was spacing out the text inside each section. Getting things to look evenly distributed was way trickier than I expected. I had to sort of guess and check text sizes and keep adjusting the padding and margins until everything felt visually lined up all the way while still keeping typography rules in mind. It took lots of small tweaks to make it feel balanced.</p>
      <p>When I got stuck I used AI to help me troubleshoot and understand what my code needed or was doing. Even small adjustments made a big difference visually. It was definitely a process of testing, fixing, and learning as I went through the project.</p>

    <div class="section white">
      <h2>How did you adapt your design for mobile?</h2>
      <p>For the mobile version, I wanted the layout to stay clean and easy to navigate so I used a hamburger menu to simplify the navigation bar on the main screen. I wanted everything to stay full width and readable without feeling cramped. It’s really difficult trying to adjust your design from desktop to mobile because you want the layout to flow nicely on a smaller screen.</p>
      <p>I tried to make sure the text and images resized in a way that kept their hierarchy clear with nothing too small or too large to fit. Using Flexbox and media queries helped me control how the layout adjusted, and I paid attention to spacing so that the design felt cohesive even on a phone.</p>

    <div class="section white">
      <h2>What did you learn about Flexbox or CSS positioning?</h2>
      <p>One big thing I learned was how much control Flexbox actually gives you once you understand it a little better. At first, it felt confusing because everything kept shifting in ways I wasn’t expecting, but after awhile it started to make more sense. I realized that using justify-content and align-items can solve a lot of layout issues that used to take me a lot longer to fix. Basically it saved me a few headaches. I also started paying closer attention to how elements sit inside their containers, and how even things like flex-wrap completely change how things line up.</p>

    <div class="section white">
      <h2>What would you add or change with more time?</h2>
      <p>If I had more time, I would polish everything including the small details that make a site feel more put together. I’d also like to refine the spacing even more so it feels perfectly balanced across all screen sizes. Adding small touches might be nice too to make it feel even more like The Sims 4.</p>
      <p>I think it would be fun to expand the project even more like adding a light theme since my page is pretty much dark theme already. Maybe even adding some motion effects that fit the Sims-style. With more time, I would keep perfecting the visual appeal of my site overall and maybe improve functionality as well.</p>
