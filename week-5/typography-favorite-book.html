  <p>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to
say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They
were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything
strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such
nonsense.
  <br>
Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck,
although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was
thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,
which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning
over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a
small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer
boy anywhere.
  <br>
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a
secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover
it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about
the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t
met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t
have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband
were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys
shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters
arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was
another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t
want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

 <p>I chose this book because it is one of my all time favorites and it reminds me of my childhood. For the title, I really wanted to go for something that felt close to the actual font used in the book/movie series and that also felt true to the story. I came across Metal Mania and thought it was perfect. I chose the font Crimson Text for the author and chapter because the serifs are very angular and I think complimented the title font nicely. The font I picked for the text was a sans-serif because I think it helps the readability of the text which is the most important part. I think the spacing here works nicely not only because I followed the layout of the in-class exercise, but also because it allows for the readers eye to flow and follow information in a way that makes sense. There is also very clear visual hierarchy represented here.</p>
