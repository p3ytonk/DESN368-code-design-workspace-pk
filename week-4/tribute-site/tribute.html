    <br>
   <p><span class="date"><ul>
     <li>1908: Cipe Pineles was born in Vienna, Austria.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1923: Her family immigrated to the United States when Cipe was a teenager, settling in New York City.</li>
     <br>
     <li>Late 1920s’: Pineles studied at the Pratt Institute, one of the few women in her classes pursuing a professional art career. Her talent and discipline quickly stood out, earning her attention in a field still dominated by men.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1932: She joined Condé Nast Publications as an assistant to the legendary art director Dr. Mehemed Fehmy Agha.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1940s’: Cipe became art director of Glamour magazine, marking a historic moment as one of the first women to hold that position at a major American magazine. Her layouts celebrated everyday women, rejecting shallow idealization in favor of authenticity and personality.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1942 - 1950: Pineles brought her modernist eye to Seventeen and later Charm and Mademoiselle, transforming the visual language of women’s magazines. She blended fine art, photography, and typography with a narrative sense.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1950s: Her reputation as both an artist and a mentor grew. She began teaching at the Parsons School of Design and other institutions, sharing her belief that design should begin with meaning not decoration.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1955: Cipe shattered another barrier when she became the first female member of the Art Directors Club of New York, after years of being nominated and rejected simply because of her gender. Her induction symbolized progress for women in professional design circles.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1960s–1970s: In these decades, she balanced editorial projects with teaching, inspiring countless students.</li>
     <br>
     <li>
1980s: As graphic design gained respect as a profession, Cipe’s earlier contributions were finally recognized. She became an icon of editorial design, known for bridging art and communication with elegance and honesty.</li>
     <br>
     <li>1991: Cipe Pineles passed away in 1991, leaving behind a body of work that redefined what design could express and who was allowed to express it. Her influence still ripples through every magazine spread that values intellect, authenticity, and story.</li>
