## Reflection

<strong>**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**</strong>
<br>
The hardest part of translating my design to code was figuring out how to have things placed in the area I intended them to be on. For example, in figma you can freely move around any and all elements with the mouse when creating a design. Translating the way that I designed my tribute page in code was really hard. I had to think about how to go about making sure the computer understood where I wanted to place things. I also had to learn how to use multiple columns which was new for me, but it wasn't too bad. It's just kind of tricky having to think about how the computer is going to structure your content based off of what you're feeding into the code. 

<strong>**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**</strong>
<br>
After doing this project I feel as though I understand div and class way better. I had to create so many to seperate all of my different content and it really helped me stay organized on where I was at when starting the CSS part of the project. 

<strong>**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**</strong>
<br>
I feel as though it is pretty close to matching my design, I definitely had to tweak a couple of things like px size because it did not translate exactly how I thought it would from FIgma to Codepen. I think as I get more comfortable coding and learn some new things, I could have made it closer to exact. If I was going to do anything differently, I would say keeping an organized document of all of the fonts and px sizes and color codes somewhere other than figma. I think having a print out of that information next to me would have made the process a little easier so I wasn't constantly going back and forth between tabs.
